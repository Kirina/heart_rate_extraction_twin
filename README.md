This repository is part of my Masters internship at AI for Health. 

The main_wave_u_net_8_channel_out.ipynb file contains the main model. This file imports functions from the utils.py and data_preprocessing.py files and its parameters from the unet_config.py file. The load_history.ipynb can present the results from the wave-u-net model. 

The ICA_final file contains the blind source separation code. It imports functions from the ICA_utils.py file. 

The generate_dataset.ipynb created the dataset to train the models.
